# Prometheus / Grafana Dashboard

build as dockerized addition to monitor resource consumption of (distributed) [CAPEv2 sandbox ](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2) 


After you've created the prometheus.yml file and have deployed the docker-compose, the rest of the steps are as follows:

- Select DataSource on home page. Select Prometheus.
- Search for: "node exporter grafana dashboards" on Google
- Look for results on grafana.com
- Find ID of the dashboard you like
(This is the dashboard I like: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11074)
- Import ID in Grafana
